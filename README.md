# Single-Cycle-Processor-Project
This repository is about the Single Cycle 16 Bit CPU project developed as part of the Computer Architecture course at FIEK (Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering) in Kosovo. This project is implemented in Verilog.

The first link contains the CPU project in EdaPlayground where you can test it out. The test instructions are as specified in the assignment requirements.

The second link contains the CPU project in EdaPlaygorund which includes some changes in the instruction memory file with different instructions from the project assignment. When executed, it displays changes in the data memory resulting from using storeword instructions for registers that take on different values after using the SLL and SRA instructions.
